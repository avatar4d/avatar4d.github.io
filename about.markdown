## whoami

My name is Chad Gross. In the most important areas of my life I am a husband and father.


### hobbies
When I am not tinkering with some technology project or another, I'm either grappling on the mat with other Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners or managing my real estate investments.



### work 

I'm a seasoned technology executive with over 15 years experience and currently searching for a new opportunity. My previous role was VP of DevOps for one of the leading EdTech companies with revenues over $500M annually and serving schools in over 100 countries. While there, I established a DevOps culture, migrated the datacenter to AWS, and automated the infrastructure with code and software delivery with CI/CD.
